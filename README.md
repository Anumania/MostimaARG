As a challenge, i made a game in one night, it was supposed to be part of a little ARG i made for some friends with a bunch of inside jokes, the code is incredibly messy because i never intended for it to scale past about where its at right now. Later on, a friend helped clean it up and add the final attacks, and now, it will be immortalised until i decide to make it mortalized.
